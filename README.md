# i3-gnome

A collection of gnome-session and xsession files required to make the i3 tiling window manager alongside GNOME Flashback. The upshot of which is that you can use i3 within a GNOME 3 session, and make use of all the utility functions gnome-flashback provides.

These files are updated to work with the most recent Ubuntu release.

* GNOME 3
* GNOME Flashback

# Installation

To install, run `sudo make install`.

# Usage

After installation the option `i3-gnome` should be visible in GDM's gear menu at login.

# Contributing
